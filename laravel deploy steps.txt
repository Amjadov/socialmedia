1- cut .htaccess and index.php from public folder to root folder

2- modify index.php and remove ../ from lines 24 and 38

change the following function to this:

public function asset($path, $secure = null)
{
    if ($this->isValidUrl($path)) {


        return $path;
    }

    // Once we get the root URL, we will check to see if it contains an index.php
    // file in the paths. If it does, we will remove it since it is not needed
    // for asset paths, but only for routes to endpoints in the application.
    $root = $this->assetRoot
                ? $this->assetRoot
                : $this->formatRoot($this->formatScheme($secure));

    // Following 2 lines were added
    if($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] != '127.0.0.1')
        $root .= '/public';

    return $this->removeIndex($root).'/'.trim($path, '/');
